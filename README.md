## Mission To Mars | Project 2: Space Challenge
**Object Oriented Programming - Udacity**

* The point when I started the project: [v1](https://github.com/RajarshiMandal/MissionToMars.git)
* Added the U1 and U2 classes: [v2](https://github.com/RajarshiMandal/MissionToMars/tree/v2)
* Added the Simulation class and done vigorous testing. *In the process failed to upload v3.*
* Not the final but did what our Instructor wanted. It's prone to typos.
